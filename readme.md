What I've learned so far

1. Git workflow

I learned how to create a git repository and update that repository via SSH.
I learn how to use variouse git functions like git add, git config, git commit, and git push.
Succefully authenticated my SSH key so that I can push my commits without github login or authentication token.
(this make using git a heck of a lot easier considering they stopped supporting terminal login)
I like that I'm using the terminal a lot more. I wrote this readme file with nano!
